      A manga/anime that centers around a boy named Izuku Midoriya, who was born without superpowers (called Quirks).  But one day he earns the recognition of All Might, the greatest hero in Japan, through his heroic act of risking his life to try and save a superpowered classmate/bully, from a villian that is attacking.  After recognizing Midoriya's hero potential, All Might decides to make Midoriya his successor and pass down his Quirk (only Quirk that can be passed down) to him and help him enroll into the prestigious U.A. High School, that train kids to become future pro heroes.
